# Compare Files Project

- Uses Tkinter to import and read file
- Logically compare files
- Uses CustomTkinter for UI
- May or may not revise in the future
## SUPER BUGGY

- App is insanely buggy
- Only works for .txt files
- Have to consistently click the "Uploaded" button for directory to show up
- But it works as intended
